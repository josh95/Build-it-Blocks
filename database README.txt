Builditblocks Database
=====================================================


Intro
=====================================================

The database is refered to as "builditblocks" written like that.
No dashes or spaces. 

The .sql containing the database exports all of the tables to a
database on your local machine. Please name this database
"builditblocks". That is how the code references it so that is how
the database must be named to avoid errors.

This contains all of the basic information of a module that does
not involve steps or applications.

ID- primary key. Used to identify each module. It is used to link
the module's steps and applications back to the module. As modules
get deleted/added, the ID may not be in counting order. This is 
fine. 

partnerID- Used to tie particular modules to a sponsor/business
partner. Not currently implemented

name- name of the module

difficulty- how hard the module is to build on a scale of 1 to 3
Not currently implemented.

description- some text used as the title text of the icons.
displays when hovering over the module icon.

date-posted- Currently used to display the most recently uploaded
module

type- the large category the module falls under. either:
junk=1,lego=2, art=3, code=4, or minecraft=5

subcategoryID- the specific category the module belongs to.
Unique to each type. Used to link to the category_table

authorID- the id assigned to the person who wrote this module

The information in the first row is actually describing the
overview of the module. The subsequent rows are actual 
applications.

ID- primary key used to order the applications. Not actually used
in the code. Its just good to have a primary key.

picture- the image path of the image related to this application

description- the text that displays when viewing this application
or overview.

link- a link to somewhere related to this application. not
